The program (in JavaScript), which finds in the array all pairs of integers whose sum is to a given value. Pairs of numbers are unique.

1. Enter the number of the amount we need to calculate.

2. A cycle that does not miss values that are not a number.

3. Generating a random array of 100 numbers ranging from 50 to -50.

4. Sorting an array in ascending order of numbers.

5. Removing duplicate numbers from an array, except the required number divided by 2.

6. A cycle consisting of 4 conditions that iterates through the array and looks for the sum of two numbers that are equal to our entered value. 
   Moving to the middle of the array.
                              
                                Enter: 20
-30, -24, -22, -10, -6, 0 , 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 15, 23, 27, 44, 47, 50
----------------------------------------------><---------------------------
                                Enter: -28
-30, -24, -22, -14, -14, -6, 0 , 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 15, 23, 27, 49
------------------><------------------------------------------------------

7. Output of the found result.

8. Displays the message about the absence of these numbers. If there are no numbers in the array, the sum of which is equal to our entered value.
